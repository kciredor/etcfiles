These are my /etc config files.
Does not include /etc/netctl/* (wifi configs).

Applies to my new setup with Arch Linux (single boot) on a Macbook Pro retina, 2012 (10.1) model.
Under active development whilst trying to accomplish a properly working linux install.


Install instructions for this setup will follow soon.
